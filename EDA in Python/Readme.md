# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

📌 Project Overview

This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal is to clean, visualize, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. EDA is a crucial step in the data science workflow, helping to understand data patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare data for further analysis or machine learning models.
